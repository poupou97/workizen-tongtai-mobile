# Current Status — 2026-07-22 (repo split day)

## Where we are

- **Phase 1 (Product Design Bible):** ✅ DONE + Founder-approved. 60 docs.
- **Phase 2 (build):** 🔄 IN PROGRESS — **22 stories verified & shipped**,
  developed autonomously by the Evidence-Driven Runtime (3 batches + pilot).
- **This repo:** split from the Hub on 2026-07-22 (`split-baseline` tag);
  app runs standalone; `flutter analyze` clean; **519/519 tests passing**.
- **Post-split fixes:** WTM-105 — split regression: `main.dart` bypassed
  `TongtaiRootGate` so the first-launch tutorial never showed; rewired + 5
  app-level boot tests (suite: 524) + ADR-TON-003 (repo split) recorded.

## NOT built yet (honest gaps)

- Finance, Reports, Opportunity Hub **screens** (DB tables exist; UI does
  not). Business Journey: goals UI có (WTM-87), step-plan/AI chờ WTM-88/89.
  AI Copilot **chat UI** (client foundation only — xem các PR chat).
- Sprint-3+ backlog (WTM-76…102: consumer detail, chat, journey, reports…)
  exists in Jira with full ACs — not yet run.
- App icon/splash = Flutter defaults (mascot "business fox" not finalized —
  open decision).
- iOS build unverified in-session (signing/SPM); Android debug build is the
  verified path. See [../migration/KNOWN-GAPS.md](../migration/KNOWN-GAPS.md).

## Next approved work

Run remaining Phase-2 backlog (Sprint 3+) via the Evidence-Driven Runtime —
same gates. Founder reviews/merges PRs into `main` of THIS repo now (the old
"merge feat/tongtai into Hub main" plan is obsolete — replaced by this split).

## History

Batch reports: [../04-DELIVERY/reports/](../04-DELIVERY/reports/) —
pilot (5 stories) → batch-01 (8, incl. the placebo-catch) → WTM-57 self-heal →
batch-02 (7 + WTM-69 network false-negative, later PASS). Pre-split git history:
Hub repo `feat/tongtai`.
